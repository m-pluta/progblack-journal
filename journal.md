# **Week 1** \~ 30/01 - 05/02

This week was not a very productive week but that was as expected. The assignment just got released on Wednesday, and so the main part of this week was spent thinking about what project to do.

From the beginning I had a feeling that I would want to work collaboratively with people from the course rather than online on an open source project. I had found a group of people to work with quite fast due to working with them on another coursework so that worked out well.

We all shared a similar interest which was we wanted to learn *TypeScript* and so it didnt take long for us to start brainstorming ideas.

We came up with a short list of ideas:
- VS-Code Extension
- VR Application
- P2P Messenger using Typescript
- Something using image recognition
- Split into two groups, one group creating a virus and another creating a detector

After coming up with this vague list, we decided it would be best to break off for the weekend to have some to reflect and potentially come up with better ideas in the following week.

We organised to meet up tomorrow (Monday 6th) after our ADS lecture in the morning.

# **Week 2** \~ 06/02 - 12/02

Following the weekend break, we all came to the conclusion that we were definitely going to be doing something to do with TypeScript and came up with a few more TypeScript related ideas which were:
- Mock banking system + database
- TypeScript or New Framework

From this list we chose the 2 projects which were most promising and they were:
- P2P Messenger using Typescript
- Mock banking system + database

We decided that the Mock banking system was the more promising project as it would allow us to learn and use a larger variety of technology.

Now that the project was decided, we established a relatively clear plan of action:
- Week 3
    - Learn TypeScript and certain technologies using typescript e.g. npm, VS-Code 
- Week 4:
    - Create front end
    - Learn basics of SQL
- Week 5:
    - Make an entity relationship diagram (ERD) for database
    - Start making backend
    - Learn specific functions of SQL related to our needed functionality
- Week 6
    - Complete backend and login system
- Week 20:
    - Polish front end
    - Fix bugs

... and set some goals for our project:
1. Learn TypeScript
2. Learn SQL
3. Write legible code with comments that any coder could understand
4. Create a functional website linked to a database
5. Create a login system for the website

Now that we had a plan and goals, we decided to create an organisation on GitHub and we named it [LMC-Enjoyers](https://github.com/LMC-Enjoyers). 

We finished off our meeting and agreed that next week's focus should be on learning TypeScript.
