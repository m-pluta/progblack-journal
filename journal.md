# **Week 1** \~ 30/01 - 05/02

This week was not a very productive week but that was as expected. The assignment just got released on Wednesday, and so the main part of this week was spent thinking about what project to do.

From the beginning I had a feeling that I would want to work collaboratively with people from the course rather than online on an open source project. I had found a group of people to work with quite fast due to working with them on another coursework so that worked out well.

We all shared a similar interest which was we wanted to learn *TypeScript* and so it didnt take long for us to start brainstorming ideas.

We came up with a short list of ideas:
- VS-Code Extension
- VR Application
- P2P Messenger using Typescript
- Something using image recognition
- Split into two groups, one group creating a virus and another creating a detector

After coming up with this vague list, we decided it would be best to break off for the weekend to have some to reflect and potentially come up with better ideas in the following week.

We organised to meet up tomorrow (Monday 6th) after our ADS lecture in the morning.
